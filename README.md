# Mageziner

This is a *Proof of Concept* Magento Frontend Theme Customizer powered by CSS variables.


## Setup

Go to `Stores / Configuration / General / Design` and ensure that Mageziner is *Enabled* or it won't show up.

## Roadmap

Feel free to create issues or pull requests. Still figuring out functionality.
