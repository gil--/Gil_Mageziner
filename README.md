# Mageziner

This is a *Proof of Concept* Magento Frontend Theme Customizer powered by CSS variables.

#### Requirements
- Modern browsers, no IE support due to CSS Variables.
- Tested on Magento 2.1.3+
- Desktop browser. No mobile styling at this time but it should still sorta work.
- Enable *localstorage* if it's disabled on your browser for some reason.

## Features

Feature list coming soon...

## Setup

Currently not installable via Composer so you must download and add to `app/code/Gil/Mageziner`. composer support is coming once this reaches a stable release (probably v0.4.0).

Go to `Stores / Configuration / General / Design` and ensure that Mageziner is ***Enabled*** or it won't show up.

## Roadmap

Feel free to create issues or pull requests. Still figuring out functionality but you can [view the feature roadmap](https://github.com/gil--/Gil_Mageziner/projects/1) for more insight.
